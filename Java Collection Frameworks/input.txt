A homeowner rents out parking spaces in a driveway during special events The
driveway is a last-in first-out stack Of course when a car owner retrieves a
vehicle that wasnâ€™t the last one in the cars blocking it must temporarily move to
the street so that the requested vehicle can leave Write a program that models this
behavior using one stack for the driveway and one stack for the street Use integers
as license plate numbers Positive numbers add a car negative numbers remove a car
zero stops the simulation Print out the stack after each operation is complete
